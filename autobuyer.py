This is the function which puts together all our sub-functions. It refreshes 
the shop ( with refresh_shop() ), and if an item in our buylist, it attempts 
to buy it. Depending on the result of the buy attempt, it returns either 1 (
for a successful buy), or -1 (for a failed buy). If no item in our buylist is 
present, it returns 0. The arguments are:

url (str): url of the shop you want to buy in
ablist (str list): a list of the items you want to buy (this is loaded from a 
  .txt file)
shopheaders (dict): when you click on an item in the shop, you need to have 
  the appropriate 'referrer' header in order to be access the haggle page. 
  this variable is declared in the menu() function below.
s: the requests session

'''
This function handles everything relating to actually buying an item. It 
visits the haggle page, solves the captcha, and submits an alternating-number 
haggle based on the price of the item (using the offer() function). It takes
four arguments:

url (str): the link to the item's haggle page (taken from the 'links') array in
  camper()
price (str): the price of the item. we pass this to the offer() function
shopheaders (str): same as shopheaders for camper()
s: the requests session

This function solves the captcha by finding the darkest pixel in the image.
For some reason, this is the correct answer 99% of the time (I believe it's 
because the neopet in the image usually has some faint black outline). TNT 
could prevent a lot of autobuyers from working properly if they just sprinkled
some black pixels throughout the captchas, but oh well, good for us!.

This function logs in to the account you've entered in the config file. It 
saves the cookie it gets, so you don't look suspicious by sending a login 
request every time you start the autobuyer. However, note that this cookie 
will be different from your browser's, so when you start the autobuyer you
will usually be automatically logged out from your browser.

Some might argue that this is also suspicious, but I've been using this for a 
few months without any issues.
